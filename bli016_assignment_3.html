	<h1>Was Alexander the Great Greek or Macedonian?</h1>
	<!-- Short introduction to what this article is about -->


	<p class="Alexander_The_Great">The nationality of <a href=
	"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great">Alexander the
	Great</a> is one issue that has fed into the ongoing naming dispute between
	<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Macedonia-region-Greece">Greece and
	the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) over the name
	‘Macedonia’</a>. We examine why the nationality of Alexander the Great remains
	a contentious issue today.</p>

	<h2>The borders have changed</h2>


	<p class="borders_changed">The ongoing debate about whether Alexander the
	Great was Greek or Macedonian stems from the fact that the geographical
	borders of the two countries have changed dramatically since Alexander the
	Great’s time. Ancient Macedonia was situated in the northern modern Greek
	peninsula, where the second-largest Greek city, Thessaloniki, is today. Modern
	Macedonia–or Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), as it is formally
	recognised–is different both geographically and in terms of its national
	population, which has more Slavic influence today than the country did in 300
	BCE.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless, both modern Greece and FYROM lay claim to Alexander the
	Great’s ancestry. In FYROM, a former Prime Minister named their airport after
	Alexander the Great and erected a huge statue in the capital, Skopje. However,
	after ongoing debate, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev ordered the name of the
	airport to be changed and the statue to be taken down.</p>

	<h2>The Olympic Games</h2>


	<p class="olympic_games">The confusion about Alexander the Great’s lineage
	isn’t solved by looking to his ancestors either. Historian <a href=
	"https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/mary-beard">Mary Beard</a> notes
	that members of <a href=
	"http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TD027bEN.html">Alexander the
	Great’s family took part in the Olympic Games</a> , which some argue is proof
	of his Greek-ness. However there was, Beard notes, ‘originally some dispute at
	the time about whether they were, or were not, Greek enough to qualify.’ Even
	though he was a Macedonian king, Alexander I was finally allowed to
	participate in the Olympic Games based on his roots in the <a href=
	"https://www.worldhistory.org/Argead_Dynasty/">Greek Argive dynasty.</a></p>


	<p>As the Olympic example shows, the national identity of Alexander the Great
	and his ancestors was complicated even during his time. Historians and
	residents of modern Greece and FYROM will likely continue to debate the
	question for as long as the name Macedonia is contended between the two
	countries.</p>


	<p>Perhaps the best answer is that he was both: a man born in Ancient
	Macedonia, the son of a Macedonian King of Greek descent, educated by the
	esteemed Greek philosopher Aristotle, who went on to spread Ancient Greek
	culture and life throughout a world that has since changed dramatically.</p>
